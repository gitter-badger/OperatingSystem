process creation

	int main(){
		int x=5;
		pid_t pid; // process id (int)
		pid=fork(); // will return twice --> parent and child
		if(pid<0){
			perror("forl failed");
			return EXIT_FAILURE;
		}
		//int x=5;
		//fork will fail if it has not enough memory 
		// sometimes the resource limit is more and hence unable to fork the new process
		if(pid==0){
			printf("child happy birthday");
			s
		}
